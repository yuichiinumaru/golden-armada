## 1. Executive Summary
This paper introduces **CAP (Cost-Aware Prediction)**, a framework that integrates ML predictions (heart failure mortality) with **Clinical Impact Projection (CIP)** and **LLM Agents**. It argues that high accuracy is not enough; agents must understand the *cost* of False Positives vs False Negatives (e.g., QoL vs Healthcare expenses). It uses 4 specialized LLM agents to explain these trade-offs to clinicians.

## 2. Detailed Key Concepts

### 2.1. Clinical Impact Projection (CIP)
-   **Cost Matrix:** explicitly defining the cost of TP, FP, TN, FN.
    -   Treatment Cost (e.g., Home Care costs money but improves QoL).
    -   Error Cost (e.g., Missing a high-risk patient is catastrophic).
-   **Visualization:** Plotting these costs across decision thresholds to find the optimal operating point, not just "Max F1 Score".

### 2.2. The 4 Agent System
1.  **Certainty Agent:** "How sure are we?" (analyzes probability calibration).
2.  **Interpretation Agent:** "What does the cost curve mean?" (explains trade-offs).
3.  **Action Agent:** "How to reduce uncertainty?" (suggests missing tests).
4.  **Future Agent:** "How to mitigate risk?" (forward-looking planning).

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost Awareness** | None | **High:** Agents treat all tasks as equal value. They don't weigh "Token Cost" vs "Feature Value" or "Refactor Risk" vs "Code Health". |
| **Impact Projection** | None | **High:** We don't simulate "What happens if this goes wrong?" (Error Cost). |
| **Explanation Agents** | Implicit | **Medium:** We have logs, but not dedicated "Explainer" agents that sit *on top* of the technical agents to summarize for humans. |

## 4. Implementation Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini)

### Phase 1: Cost Matrix for Code
-   **Action:** Define a "Cost Matrix" for DevTasks.
    -   **FP (Bad Fix):** Cost = Revert time + Frustration.
    -   **FN (Missed Bug):** Cost = Production Incident.
-   **Usage:** When Planner prioritizes tasks, use this matrix. "Fixing this critical bug (High FN cost) is worth more than refactoring this test (Low FP cost)."

### Phase 2: Impact Analysis Agent
-   **Action:** Create an `ImpactAgent`.
-   **Role:** Before a PR is merged, it calculates:
    -   "Risk Score" (Probability of breaking build).
    -   "Impact Score" (Number of dependent files).
-   **Output:** "Merge blocked. Risk (0.8) > Threshold (0.5)."

### Phase 3: The Explainer
-   **Action:** Add a "Summarizer" step to `AgentOS` that explains the *why* behind the Plan, using the CAP structure ("We chose this path because the cost of error was lower").
