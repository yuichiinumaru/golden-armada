## 1. Executive Summary
This paper explores the security implications of integrating GenAI into 6G networks. It highlights cross-domain vulnerabilities where attacks on physical signals (ISAC) can propagate to cognitive models (LTMs) and Digital Twins (DTs). To mitigate this, it proposes an **Adaptive Evolutionary Defense (AED)** framework where defense policies "co-evolve" with attacks through continuous, GenAI-driven red-teaming and simulation.

## 2. Detailed Key Concepts

### 2.1. The "Cognitive" 6G Stack
-   **ISAC:** Sensing layer (Eyes/Ears).
-   **Digital Twin (DT):** Synchronization layer (World Model).
-   **Large Telecom Model (LTM):** Reasoning layer (Brain).
-   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects noise into ISAC -> DT gets desynchronized -> LTM makes bad decisions based on fake DT state.

### 2.2. Adaptive Evolutionary Defense (AED)
A continuous loop:
1.  **Policy Generator (PG):** Evolves new defense strategies (e.g., "Increase redundancy", "Switch frequency").
2.  **Fitness Evaluator (FE):** A GenAI-based "Red Team" simulates attacks against these strategies in the Digital Twin.
3.  **Coordinator:** Deploys the fittest strategy to the real network.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Twin (Simulation)** | Sandbox (Basic) | **High:** We run code in a sandbox, but we don't have a "Shadow Repo" for continuous evolutionary testing. |
| **Evolutionary Defense** | Reactive Fixes | **Medium:** We fix bugs after they happen. AED *proactively* evolves defenses by simulating attacks. |
| **Cross-Layer Security** | Siloed | **Medium:** We treat "Code Security" separate from "Prompt Injection". AED treats them as a unified attack surface. |

## 4. Implementation Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini)

### Phase 1: The "Repo Twin" (Digital Twin)
-   **Action:** Create a mechanism to clone the repo into a temporary "Shadow Branch" (the Twin).
-   **Usage:** Before applying complex changes to `main`, apply them to `shadow`. Run the "Red Team Agent" against `shadow`.

### Phase 2: Evolutionary Red Teaming
-   **Action:** Create a `RedTeamAgent`.
-   **Goal:** "Try to break this code." (e.g. Input fuzzing, deleting config files, injecting SQL).
-   **Loop:**
    1.  DevAgent writes code.
    2.  RedTeamAgent attacks it in the Twin.
    3.  If broken, DevAgent "evolves" (patches).
    4.  Repeat until robust.

### Phase 3: LTM-driven Policy
-   **Action:** Use Gemini (LTM) to generate "Security Policies" for the project (e.g., "All inputs must be sanitized") and enforce them via the Admin Agent.
