## Phase 7: Future Development - Advanced Agent Capabilities & MCP Integration

- [ ] **In-Depth Analysis of External AI Agent Frameworks & Systems:** Conduct a systematic and in-depth analysis of the following external AI agent frameworks and systems. The objectives are to extract relevant code structures, agent designs, tool definitions, MCP usage, prompting strategies, and architectural patterns, and to formulate a 'translation plan' or a set of recommendations for adapting these findings to the CodeSwarm ADK environment. This research will inform other future development tasks.

- [ ] **Evaluate & Prototype MCP Integrations:**
    - [ ] Systematically evaluate selected MCPs (listed in `docs/mcp_integration_ideas.md` and `docs/mcp_candidates_temp.md`) for their utility to CodeSwarm.
    - [ ] Prototype integration of 1-2 high-priority MCPs (e.g., for Code Execution, Git/Repository Analysis, or Terminal Access) as ADK `McpTool`s.
    - [ ] Document findings and best practices for MCP tool integration within CodeSwarm.
- [ ] **Design & Implement Specialized Support Agents:**
    - [ ] Design and prototype a `PlannerAgent` to assist the AdminAgent in breaking down complex goals and managing task dependencies.
    - [ ] Design and prototype a `ReporterAgent` to automatically generate summaries or documentation drafts based on project activities.
    - [ ] Explore enhancing the `ResearcherAgent` with more targeted search strategies or RAG capabilities.
- [ ] **Develop Granular State Management & Logging:**
    - [ ] Design and implement a more structured approach for managing detailed project state by the AdminAgent.
    - [ ] Investigate and implement strategies for more detailed "internal monologue" or reasoning step logging from all agents, potentially using ADK callbacks and structured log formats.
- [ ] **Develop Dockerized Environment for CodeSwarm & MCPs:**
    - [ ] Investigate creating a `docker-compose.yml` or similar Docker configuration to deploy CodeSwarm alongside selected MCP tool dependencies.
    - [ ] Document the setup and usage of this Dockerized environment.
- [ ] **Consolidate MCP Documentation:** Merge `docs/mcp_candidates_temp.md` into `docs/mcp_integration_ideas.md` once file editing tools are stable or as a manual step.
