# D-GARA: Benchmarking Agent Robustness in Real-World Anomalies

**Source:** [D-GARA: A Dynamic Benchmarking Framework for GUI Agent Robustness in Real-World Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.16590)

## Synthesis
This paper introduces **D-GARA**, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Android GUI agents against **Real-World Anomalies**.
*   **The Problem:** Most benchmarks assume a "Happy Path" (perfect environment). In reality, users face interruptions: Low Battery warnings, "Rate this App" popups, Network failures, and App Crashes.
*   **The Findings:** Current SOTA agents (GPT-4o, UI-TARS) degrade significantly (up to 35% drop) when faced with these interruptions. They often get stuck, click "Close" blindly (missing the task context), or fail to recover state after an app crash ("Perception Drift" - assuming they are still on the search page when the app restarted).
*   **Methodology:** D-GARA injects anomalies programmatically during task execution and uses a **State-Centric Validator** (checking the final XML state) rather than action matching, allowing agents to take detours (e.g., handling a popup) and still succeed.

## Core Strategic Ideas
1.  **Anomaly Injection in Testing:** We should not just test our agents on "clean" tasks. We need to introduce **"Chaos Engineering" for Agents**. Randomly disconnect the database, throw a 500 error, or introduce a "Merge Conflict" in the middle of a task to see if the agent recovers.
2.  **State-Centric Validation:** Don't judge an agent by *how* it solved the problem (exact sequence of steps), judge it by the *result*. "Did the code run?" is better than "Did you type these exact characters?".
3.  **Perception Drift Awareness:** Agents have "short-term memory" of where they *think* they are. If an external event (crash, error) changes the state, the agent must be forced to **re-orient** (re-read the screen/logs) rather than acting on stale memory.

## Integration Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini 3)
1.  **Chaos Agent:**
    *   Create a specialized "Chaos Monkey" agent in CodeSwarm.
    *   During CI/CD simulations, this agent randomly:
        *   Deletes a file the Developer Agent is working on.
        *   Adds a syntax error to a dependency.
        *   Simulates a "Git Lock" error.
    *   This forces the Developer Agent to implement **Error Recovery** logic (e.g., `try...catch` blocks in its own tool usage).

2.  **Robustness Metrics:**
    *   Track `Robust Success Rate (RSR)` in SurrealDB.
    *   `RSR = (Success with Anomalies) / (Success without Anomalies)`.
    *   If RSR drops below 0.8, flag the agent prompt for refinement (e.g., "Always check file existence before writing").

3.  **State Re-Orientation:**
    *   In our `AgentOS` loop, after *any* tool error (e.g., `FileNotFound`), force a **mandatory observation step** (e.g., `ls -la`) before the agent is allowed to take another action. This prevents "Perception Drift".
