DOC LINKS FORMAT
- This folder contains the documentation for all libraries used in the project.
- But instead of literally placing large chunks of text here, we will link to the official documentation of each library in a list of links.

Why?
- Because placing large chunks of text here would be counterproductive, it would blow up context window unnecessarily, and it would require constant updates and maintenance.
- By placing the link list pointing directly to the official website, we keep documentation up to date, and prevent context blow - you can simply choose to read just the articles relative to the task at hand.
- But don't pretend you can't do anything about it - READ the arcticles using the tools you have to access the internet.
