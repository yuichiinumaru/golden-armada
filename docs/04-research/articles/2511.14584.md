## 1. Executive Summary
ReflexGrad proposes a three-way synergistic architecture for LLM agents to achieve zero-shot generalization. It combines:
1.  **Hierarchical TODO Decomposition:** Breaking down tasks strategically.
2.  **History-Aware Causal Reflection:** Analyzing recent action traces to identify root causes of failures (within-trial learning).
3.  **Gradient-Based Optimization:** Systematically improving performance using textual gradients (TextGrad approach).

The system achieves 67% zero-shot success on ALFWorld, demonstrating that combining these mechanisms is more effective than using them in isolation.

## 2. Key Concepts & Brainstorming
*   **Causal Reflection Loop:** Instead of just "retrying" with error message, explicitly ask the model to analyze the *history of actions* to find the *causal* reason for failure before planning the next step.
*   **Textual Gradients (TextGrad):** Use the failure feedback to optimize the *system prompt* or *instructions* for the next attempt, effectively "training" the agent in-context or across episodes.
*   **Synergy of Planning + Reflection:** Planning provides the structure; reflection repairs the plan based on execution reality.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current State in CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hierarchical Planning | Implemented (Planner -> Admin -> Dev) | Good alignment. |
| Causal Reflection | Basic Feedback Loop (Revisor -> Dev) | Missing explicit *causal analysis* of the action history. Revisor just checks output, doesn't necessarily analyze the *process* or *trace*. |
| Gradient-Based Optimization | Not implemented | Missing. We don't systematically update prompts based on failures. |

## 4. Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Enhance Feedback Loop:** Modify the Revisor-to-Dev loop. If rejected, insert a "Reflection Step" where the Dev (or a specialized agent) analyzes the *conversation history* and *file changes* to explain *why* it failed, before attempting a fix.
- [ ] **Store Reflections:** Use SurrealDB to store successful and failed traces with their reflections.
- [ ] **Prompt Optimization:** Experiment with updating the DevAgent's system prompt dynamically for the next retry based on the reflection (a simple form of TextGrad).
