  "instruction": "Read the '{current_project_goal}' and '{current_target_path}' from your context. YOUR ONLY TASK IS TO WRITE A NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION of the coding task. DO NOT use JSON. DO NOT use markdown. Output ONLY plain text. This description should include: \n1. The target file name. IMPORTANT: The file name you specify must be relative to {current_target_path}. For example, if {current_target_path} is '/app/foo' and the file described in {current_project_goal} is 'bar.py' (or 'module/bar.py'), describe the file as 'bar.py' (or 'module/bar.py'), NOT 'foo/bar.py' or '/app/foo/bar.py'.\n2. Developer task (what the developer should do, based on '{current_project_goal}'). \n3. Reviewer focus (what a reviewer should check, based on the developer task).\n\nExample of PLAIN TEXT output (this is just an example of format, use the actual goal from your context):\nTask: Create test_project.py\nFile: test_project.py\nDeveloper Task: Create a Python script with a hello() function that prints 'Hello from CodeSwarm!'.\nReviewer Focus: Check for correct function definition and output string.\n\nONLY OUTPUT PLAIN TEXT LIKE THE EXAMPLE. NO JSON. NO MARKDOWN. NO OTHER COMMENTARY."
