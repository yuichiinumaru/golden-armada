# JAN (Jenova Agent Nexus) Project

JAN is an advanced platform for creating, managing, and utilizing AI agent systems, with an initial focus on complex software development tasks. It aims to provide a robust framework for multi-agent collaboration, extensible tooling, and integrated knowledge management.

## Core Components

*   **CodeSwarm Engine:** The primary task execution engine within JAN, featuring a team of specialized AI agents (Admin, Developer, Revisor) built using the Google ADK. CodeSwarm handles the breakdown and execution of software development goals.
*   **Easy MCP Creator (Planned):** A feature to simplify the integration and management of various MCP-compliant tools and services, enhancing agent capabilities.
*   **RAG Integration (Planned):** Retrieval Augmented Generation will be integrated to provide agents with access to diverse knowledge sources like codebases, documentation, and best practices.

## Technology Stack

*   **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit):** For core agent development and orchestration.
*   **Gemini Models:** Leveraging Google's Gemini family of models for agent intelligence.
*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** For planned integration with external tools and services.
*   **Python:** Primary development language.

## Getting Started & Documentation
