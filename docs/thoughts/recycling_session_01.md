# Recycling Thoughts - Session 01
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Objective:** Scanning `old-codeswarm` for components to archive or recycle into the new Agno-based architecture.

## Context Refresher
The current system has migrated to **Agno** and **SurrealDB**. The `old-codeswarm` folder likely contains logic from previous iterations (ADK, phidata earlier versions, etc.) that may still have valuable prompting logic or tool implementations.

## Observations (Initial Scan)
*(Pending file listing)*
