## 1. Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for **safe autonomous exploration** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Key components include a GNN-based policy for selecting exploration waypoints from a graph representation of the environment, and a **Safety Filter** that overrides unsafe actions with the closest feasible alternative. It introduces a **Safety-Gated Adaptive (SGA)** reward function to balance exploration efficiency and safety.

## 2. Detailed Key Concepts

### 2.1. Exploration Graph & GNN Policy
-   **Observation:** The environment is converted into a graph where nodes are agent positions, frontiers (unexplored edges), and waypoints.
-   **Policy:** A GNN (with Attention) processes this graph to select the next node to visit. This abstracts away low-level physics, making it "Platform-Agnostic".

### 2.2. The Safety Filter
A hard-coded module $\sigma(a)$ acts as a gate.
-   If action $a$ is safe: Execute.
-   If unsafe: Replace with $a'$ which maximizes cosine similarity to $a$ but is safe.

### 2.3. SGA Reward
-   **Unsafe Penalty:** Large negative reward if Safety Filter is triggered.
-   **Discovery Reward:** Positive reward for uncovering new cells.
-   **Potential Field:** Reward based on distance to frontiers (encourages moving towards the unknown).

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Graph-Based Navigation** | File tree | **Medium:** We treat the codebase as a tree. A graph (imports/deps) would be richer for "exploring" complex logic. |
| **Safety Filter** | Basic Checks | **High:** We don't have a dedicated "Filter" module that *modifies* unsafe actions into safe ones (we just fail). |
| **Frontier-Based Discovery** | Linear search | **Low:** When "learning" a repo, we just read files. A "Frontier" approach (follow imports) might be more efficient. |

## 4. Implementation Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini)

### Phase 1: The Safety Filter Wrapper
-   **Action:** Wrap the `DevAgent`'s tool execution.
-   **Logic:** `def execute_safe(tool_call):`
    -   Check if `tool_call` is safe (e.g., not deleting `main.py`).
    -   If unsafe, *modify* it (e.g., change `rm` to `mv` to backup folder) or block.
    -   Log the intervention (Penalty).

### Phase 2: Codebase Exploration Graph
-   **Action:** Use `KnowledgeAgent` to build a graph of the repo in SurrealDB (Files = Nodes, Imports = Edges).
-   **Policy:** When asked to "Understand the repo", use a graph traversal strategy (BFS/DFS on the Import Graph) rather than reading files alphabetically.

### Phase 3: Frontier Reward
-   **Action:** Gamify the "Knowledge Acquisition". Agent gets points for reading "High Centrality" files (files imported by many others) first.
