## 1. Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to enhance autonomous scientific discovery agents by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The core innovation is using a **VLM-as-a-judge** to evaluate generated plots and figures against dynamically created rubrics. This visual feedback loop allows agents to self-correct and significantly outperforms code-only verification methods (0.7-0.8 pass rate vs 0.2-0.3).

## 2. Key Concepts & Brainstorming
*   **VLM-as-a-Judge:** Using multimodal LLMs to "see" the output (plots, UIs) and verify it against natural language requirements.
*   **Dynamic Rubrics:** Generating specific criteria for visual verification (e.g., "Check if the graph has a legend", "Verify the trend is increasing").
*   **Visual Feedback Loop:** Passing the VLM's visual critique back to the coding agent to fix the plotting code.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current State in CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Multimodal Verification | Non-existent. Revisor checks code only. | Huge gap. We cannot verify UI appearance or generated artifacts (images/plots). |
| VLM Integration | Gemini is used, but likely text-only mode for code. | Underutilizing Gemini's vision capabilities. |

## 4. Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Frontend/Artifact Verification:** Implement a workflow where, if the task involves UI or data viz, a screenshot/image is generated (e.g., via Playwright).
- [ ] **Visual Revisor:** Upgrade RevisorAgent to accept image inputs. Use Gemini to compare the screenshot against the design description.
- [ ] **Rubric Generation:** Add a step where the Admin/Planner generates a "Visual Checklist" for the task, which the Visual Revisor uses.
