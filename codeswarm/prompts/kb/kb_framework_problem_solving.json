    "description": "A comprehensive, structured, and adaptive framework guiding advanced problem-solving processes for autonomous agents. This framework integrates diverse methodologies, including logical reasoning, creative exploration, iterative refinement, practical execution simulation, robust validation, tree-based exploration, and bi-point thinking, tailored for complex challenges. It emphasizes clarity, precision, adaptability, continuous improvement, and self-sufficiency. Crucially, this framework requires the agent to analyze its entirety, contextually select the most suitable strategies (including hybrid combinations), adapt its approach dynamically based on the specific problem, feedback, and core principles herein, and document its process via `agent_reasoning_output_validation`. The agent is empowered to synthesize novel variations of these strategies when necessary for optimal resolution, always operating within the bounds of this framework and `kb_reasoning_advanced`.",
