# 👋 OpenManus

Manus is incredible, but OpenManus can achieve any idea without an *Invite Code* 🛫!

Our team members [@Xinbin Liang](https://github.com/mannaandpoem) and [@Jinyu Xiang](https://github.com/XiangJinyu) (core authors), along with [@Zhaoyang Yu](https://github.com/MoshiQAQ), [@Jiayi Zhang](https://github.com/didiforgithub), and [@Sirui Hong](https://github.com/stellaHSR), we are from [@MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT). The prototype is launched within 3 hours and we are keeping building!

It's a simple implementation, so we welcome any suggestions, contributions, and feedback!

Enjoy your own agent with OpenManus!

We're also excited to introduce [OpenManus-RL](https://github.com/OpenManus/OpenManus-RL), an open-source project dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL)- based (such as GRPO) tuning methods for LLM agents, developed collaboratively by researchers from UIUC and OpenManus.

## Project Demo

## Installation

We provide two installation methods. Method 2 (using uv) is recommended for faster installation and better dependency management.

### Method 1: Using conda

1. Create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n open_manus python=3.12
conda activate open_manus
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Using uv (Recommended)

1. Install uv (A fast Python package installer and resolver):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Browser Automation Tool (Optional)
```bash
playwright install
```

## Configuration

OpenManus requires configuration for the LLM APIs it uses. Follow these steps to set up your configuration:

1. Create a `config.toml` file in the `config` directory (you can copy from the example):

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. Edit `config/config.toml` to add your API keys and customize settings:

```toml
# Global LLM configuration
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# Optional configuration for specific LLM models
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
```

## Quick Start

One line for run OpenManus:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then input your idea via terminal!

For MCP tool version, you can run:
```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

For unstable multi-agent version, you also can run:

```bash
python run_flow.py
```

### Custom Adding Multiple Agents

Currently, besides the general OpenManus Agent, we have also integrated the DataAnalysis Agent, which is suitable for data analysis and data visualization tasks. You can add this agent to `run_flow` in `config.toml`.

```toml
# Optional configuration for run-flow
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # Disabled by default, change to true to activate
```
In addition, you need to install the relevant dependencies to ensure the agent runs properly: [Detailed Installation Guide](app/tool/chart_visualization/README.md##Installation)

FILE: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
================================================
# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
mannaandpoem@gmail.com
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Slack and Discord Etiquettes

These Slack and Discord etiquette guidelines are designed to foster an inclusive, respectful, and productive environment
for all community members. By following these best practices, we ensure effective communication and collaboration while
minimizing disruptions. Let’s work together to build a supportive and welcoming community!

- Communicate respectfully and professionally, avoiding sarcasm or harsh language, and remember that tone can be
  difficult to interpret in text.
- Use threads for specific discussions to keep channels organized and easier to follow.
- Tag others only when their input is critical or urgent, and use @here, @channel or @everyone sparingly to minimize
  disruptions.
- Be patient, as open-source contributors and maintainers often have other commitments and may need time to respond.
- Post questions or discussions in the most relevant
  channel ([discord - #general](https://discord.com/channels/1125308739348594758/1138430348557025341)).
- When asking for help or raising issues, include necessary details like links, screenshots, or clear explanations to
  provide context.
- Keep discussions in public channels whenever possible to allow others to benefit from the conversation, unless the
  matter is sensitive or private.
- Always adhere to [our standards](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#our-standards)
  to ensure a welcoming and collaborative environment.
- If you choose to mute a channel, consider setting up alerts for topics that still interest you to stay engaged. For
  Slack, Go to Settings → Notifications → My Keywords to add specific keywords that will notify you when mentioned. For
  example, if you're here for discussions about LLMs, mute the channel if it’s too busy, but set notifications to alert
  you only when “LLMs” appears in messages. Also for Discord, go to the channel notifications and choose the option that
  best describes your need.

```

## 設定

OpenManusを使用するには、LLM APIの設定が必要です。以下の手順に従って設定してください：

1. `config`ディレクトリに`config.toml`ファイルを作成します（サンプルからコピーできます）：

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. `config/config.toml`を編集してAPIキーを追加し、設定をカスタマイズします：

```toml
# グローバルLLM設定
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 実際のAPIキーに置き換えてください
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# 特定のLLMモデル用のオプション設定
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 実際のAPIキーに置き換えてください
```

## クイックスタート

OpenManusを実行する一行コマンド：

```bash
python main.py
```

その後、ターミナルからプロンプトを入力してください！

MCP ツールバージョンを使用する場合は、以下を実行します：
```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

開発中のマルチエージェントバージョンを試すには、以下を実行します：

```bash
python run_flow.py
```

## カスタムマルチエージェントの追加

現在、一般的なOpenManusエージェントに加えて、データ分析とデータ可視化タスクに適したDataAnalysisエージェントが組み込まれています。このエージェントを`config.toml`の`run_flow`に追加することができます。

```toml
# run-flowのオプション設定
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # デフォルトでは無効、trueに変更すると有効化されます
```

これに加えて、エージェントが正常に動作するために必要な依存関係をインストールする必要があります：[具体的なインストールガイド](app/tool/chart_visualization/README_ja.md##インストール)

## 설치 방법

두 가지 설치 방법을 제공합니다. **방법 2 (uv 사용)** 이 더 빠른 설치와 효율적인 종속성 관리를 위해 권장됩니다.

### 방법 1: conda 사용

1. 새로운 conda 환경을 생성합니다:

```bash
conda create -n open_manus python=3.12
conda activate open_manus
```

2. 저장소를 클론합니다:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. 종속성을 설치합니다:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 방법 2: uv 사용 (권장)

1. uv를 설치합니다. (빠른 Python 패키지 설치 및 종속성 관리 도구):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. 저장소를 클론합니다:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. 새로운 가상 환경을 생성하고 활성화합니다:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS의 경우
# Windows의 경우:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. 종속성을 설치합니다:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 브라우저 자동화 도구 (선택사항)
```bash
playwright install
```

## 설정 방법

OpenManus를 사용하려면 사용하는 LLM API에 대한 설정이 필요합니다. 아래 단계를 따라 설정을 완료하세요:

1. `config` 디렉토리에 `config.toml` 파일을 생성하세요 (예제 파일을 복사하여 사용할 수 있습니다):

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. `config/config.toml` 파일을 편집하여 API 키를 추가하고 설정을 커스터마이징하세요:

```toml
# 전역 LLM 설정
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 실제 API 키로 변경하세요
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# 특정 LLM 모델에 대한 선택적 설정
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 실제 API 키로 변경하세요
```

## 빠른 시작

OpenManus를 실행하는 한 줄 명령어:

```bash
python main.py
```

이후 터미널에서 아이디어를 작성하세요!

MCP 도구 버전을 사용하려면 다음을 실행하세요:
```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

불안정한 멀티 에이전트 버전을 실행하려면 다음을 실행할 수 있습니다:

```bash
python run_flow.py
```

### 사용자 정의 다중 에이전트 추가

현재 일반 OpenManus 에이전트 외에도 데이터 분석 및 데이터 시각화 작업에 적합한 DataAnalysis 에이전트를 통합했습니다. 이 에이전트를 `config.toml`의 `run_flow`에 추가할 수 있습니다.

```toml
# run-flow에 대한 선택적 구성
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # 기본적으로 비활성화되어 있으며, 활성화하려면 true로 변경
```

또한, 에이전트가 제대로 작동하도록 관련 종속성을 설치해야 합니다: [상세 설치 가이드](app/tool/chart_visualization/README.md##Installation)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. 创建并激活虚拟环境：

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS 系统
# Windows 系统使用：
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. 安装依赖：

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 浏览器自动化工具（可选）
```bash
playwright install
```

## 配置说明

OpenManus 需要配置使用的 LLM API，请按以下步骤设置：

1. 在 `config` 目录创建 `config.toml` 文件（可从示例复制）：

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. 编辑 `config/config.toml` 添加 API 密钥和自定义设置：

```toml
# 全局 LLM 配置
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 替换为真实 API 密钥
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# 可选特定 LLM 模型配置
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # 替换为真实 API 密钥
```

## 快速启动

一行命令运行 OpenManus：

```bash
python main.py
```

然后通过终端输入你的创意！

如需使用 MCP 工具版本，可运行：
```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

如需体验不稳定的多智能体版本，可运行：

```bash
python run_flow.py
```

## 添加自定义多智能体

目前除了通用的 OpenManus Agent, 我们还内置了DataAnalysis Agent，适用于数据分析和数据可视化任务，你可以在`config.toml`中将这个智能体加入到`run_flow`中
```toml
# run-flow可选配置
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # 默认关闭，将其改为true则为激活
```
除此之外，你还需要安装相关的依赖来确保智能体正常运行：[具体安装指南](app/tool/chart_visualization/README_zh.md##安装)

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{{"current_state": {{"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"}},
"action":[{{"one_action_name": {{// action-specific parameter}}}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {{max_actions}} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{{"input_text": {{"index": 1, "text": "username"}}}}, {{"input_text": {{"index": 2, "text": "password"}}}}, {{"click_element": {{"index": 3}}}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{{"go_to_url": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}}, {{"extract_content": {{"goal": "extract the names"}}}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps.
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task.

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory.

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.
"""

NEXT_STEP_PROMPT = """
What should I do next to achieve my goal?

When you see [Current state starts here], focus on the following:
- Current URL and page title{url_placeholder}
- Available tabs{tabs_placeholder}
- Interactive elements and their indices
- Content above{content_above_placeholder} or below{content_below_placeholder} the viewport (if indicated)
- Any action results or errors{results_placeholder}

For browser interactions:
- To navigate: browser_use with action="go_to_url", url="..."
- To click: browser_use with action="click_element", index=N
- To type: browser_use with action="input_text", index=N, text="..."
- To extract: browser_use with action="extract_content", goal="..."
- To scroll: browser_use with action="scroll_down" or "scroll_up"

Consider both what's visible and what might be beyond the current viewport.
Be methodical - remember your progress and what you've learned so far.

If you want to stop the interaction at any point, use the `terminate` tool/function call.

- For multimedia responses (like images), you'll receive a description of the content

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {{WINDOW}} lines of a file at a time.
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.
To call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.

Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.
If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
(Open file: <path>)
(Current directory: <cwd>)
bash-$

First, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.
Then, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.

Remember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second tool call.
Note that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command=`ctrl+c` to interrupt the process.
* Timeout: If a command execution result says "Command timed out. Sending SIGINT to the process", the assistant should retry running the command in the background.

A powerful browser automation tool that allows interaction with web pages through various actions.
* This tool provides commands for controlling a browser session, navigating web pages, and extracting information
* It maintains state across calls, keeping the browser session alive until explicitly closed
* Use this when you need to browse websites, fill forms, click buttons, extract content, or perform web searches
* Each action requires specific parameters as defined in the tool's dependencies

Key capabilities include:
* Navigation: Go to specific URLs, go back, search the web, or refresh pages
* Interaction: Click elements, input text, select from dropdowns, send keyboard commands
* Scrolling: Scroll up/down by pixel amount or scroll to specific text
* Content extraction: Extract and analyze content from web pages based on specific goals
* Tab management: Switch between tabs, open new tabs, or close tabs

Note: When using element indices, refer to the numbered elements shown in the current browser state.

* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file

* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique

# Chart Visualization Tool

The chart visualization tool generates data processing code through Python and ultimately invokes [@visactor/vmind](https://github.com/VisActor/VMind) to obtain chart specifications. Chart rendering is implemented using [@visactor/vchart](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart).

## Installation (Mac / Linux)

1. Install node >= 18

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# Activate nvm, for example in Bash
source ~/.bashrc
# Then install the latest stable release of Node
nvm install node
# Activate usage, for example if the latest stable release is 22, then use 22
nvm use 22
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the appropriate location in the current repository
cd app/tool/chart_visualization
npm install
```

## Installation (Windows)
1. Install nvm-windows

    Download the latest version `nvm-setup.exe` from the [official GitHub page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) and install it.

2. Use nvm to install node

```powershell
# Then install the latest stable release of Node
nvm install node
# Activate usage, for example if the latest stable release is 22, then use 22
nvm use 22
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the appropriate location in the current repository
cd app/tool/chart_visualization
npm install
```

## Tool
### python_execute

Execute the necessary parts of data analysis (excluding data visualization) using Python code, including data processing, data summary, report generation, and some general Python script code.

#### Input
```typescript
{
  // Code type: data processing/data report/other general tasks
  code_type: "process" | "report" | "others"
  // Final execution code
  code: string;
}
```

#### Output
Python execution results, including the saving of intermediate files and print output results.

### visualization_preparation

A pre-tool for data visualization with two purposes,

#### Data -> Chart
Used to extract the data needed for analysis (.csv) and the corresponding visualization description from the data, ultimately outputting a JSON configuration file.

#### Chart + Insight -> Chart
Select existing charts and corresponding data insights, choose data insights to add to the chart in the form of data annotations, and finally generate a JSON configuration file.

#### Input
```typescript
{
  // Code type: data visualization or data insight addition
  code_type: "visualization" | "insight"
  // Python code used to produce the final JSON file
  code: string;
}
```

#### Output
A configuration file for data visualization, used for the `data_visualization tool`.

## data_visualization

Generate specific data visualizations based on the content of `visualization_preparation`.

### Input
```typescript
{
  // Configuration file path
  json_path: string;
  // Current purpose, data visualization or insight annotation addition
  tool_type: "visualization" | "insight";
  // Final product png or html; html supports vchart rendering and interaction
  output_type: 'png' | 'html'
  // Language, currently supports Chinese and English
  language: "zh" | "en"
}
```

## VMind Configuration

### LLM

VMind requires LLM invocation for intelligent chart generation. By default, it uses the `config.llm["default"]` configuration.

### Generation Settings

Main configurations include chart dimensions, theme, and generation method:
### Generation Method
Default: png. Currently supports automatic selection of `output_type` by LLM based on context.

### Dimensions
Default dimensions are unspecified. For HTML output, charts fill the entire page by default. For PNG output, defaults to `1000*1000`.

### Theme
Default theme: `'light'`. VChart supports multiple themes. See [Themes](https://www.visactor.io/vchart/guide/tutorial_docs/Theme/Theme_Extension).

## Test

Currently, three tasks of different difficulty levels are set for testing.

### Simple Chart Generation Task

Provide data and specific chart generation requirements, test results, execute the command:
```bash
python -m app.tool.chart_visualization.test.chart_demo
```
The results should be located under `workspace\visualization`, involving 9 different chart results.

### Simple Data Report Task

Provide simple raw data analysis requirements, requiring simple processing of the data, execute the command:
```bash
python -m app.tool.chart_visualization.test.report_demo
```
The results are also located under `workspace\visualization`.

3. Save information in json file.( format: {"csvFilePath": string, "chartTitle": string}[])
## Insight Type
1. Select the insights from the data_visualization results that you want to add to the chart.
2. Save information in json file.( format: {"chartPath": string, "insights_id": number[]}[])
# Note
1. You can generate one or multiple csv data with different visualization needs.
2. Make each chart data esay, clean and different.
3. Json file saving in utf-8 with path print: print(json_path)

  output_type: 'png' | 'html'
  // 언어, 현재 중국어 및 영어 지원
  language: "zh" | "en"
}
```

## VMind 구성

### LLM

VMind는 지능형 차트 생성을 위해 LLM 호출이 필요합니다. 기본적으로 `config.llm["default"]` 구성을 사용합니다.

### 생성 설정

주요 구성에는 차트 크기, 테마 및 생성 방법이 포함됩니다.
### 생성 방법
기본값: png. 현재 LLM이 컨텍스트에 따라 `output_type`을 자동으로 선택하는 것을 지원합니다.

### 크기
기본 크기는 지정되지 않았습니다. HTML 출력의 경우 차트는 기본적으로 전체 페이지를 채웁니다. PNG 출력의 경우 기본값은 `1000*1000`입니다.

### 테마
기본 테마: `'light'`. VChart는 여러 테마를 지원합니다. [테마](https://www.visactor.io/vchart/guide/tutorial_docs/Theme/Theme_Extension)를 참조하세요.

#### 输入
```typescript
{
  // 代码类型：数据处理/数据报告/其他通用任务
  code_type: "process" | "report" | "others"
  // 最终执行代码
  code: string;
}
```

#### 输出
python执行结果，带有中间文件的保存和print输出结果

### visualization_preparation

数据可视化前置工具，有两种用途，

#### Data -〉 Chart
用于从数据中提取需要分析的数据(.csv)和对应可视化的描述，最终输出一份json配置文件。

#### Chart + Insight -> Chart
选取已有的图表和对应的数据洞察，挑选数据洞察以数据标注的形式增加到图表中，最终生成一份json配置文件。

#### 输入
```typescript
{
  // 代码类型：数据可视化 或者 数据洞察添加
  code_type: "visualization" | "insight"
  // 用于生产最终json文件的python代码
  code: string;
}
```

#### 输出
数据可视化的配置文件，用于`data_visualization tool`


## data_visualization

根据`visualization_preparation`的内容，生成具体的数据可视化

### 输入
```typescript
{
  // 配置文件路径
  json_path: string;
  // 当前用途，数据可视化或者洞察标注添加
  tool_type: "visualization" | "insight";
  // 最终产物png或者html;html下支持vchart渲染和交互
  output_type: 'png' | 'html'
  // 语言,目前支持中文和英文
  language: "zh" | "en"
}
```

## 输出
最终以'png'或者'html'的形式保存在本地，输出保存的图表路径以及图表中发现的数据洞察

## VMind配置

### LLM

VMind本身也需要通过调用大模型得到智能图表生成结果，目前默认会使用`config.llm["default"]`配置

### 生成配置

主要生成配置包括图表的宽高、主题以及生成方式；
### 生成方式
默认为png，目前支持大模型根据上下文自己选择`output_type`

### 宽高
目前默认不指定宽高，`html`下默认占满整个页面，'png'下默认为`1000 * 1000`

### 主题
目前默认主题为`'light'`，VChart图表支持多种主题，详见[主题](https://www.visactor.io/vchart/guide/tutorial_docs/Theme/Theme_Extension)


## 测试

当前设置了三种不同难度的任务用于测试

### 简单图表生成任务

给予数据和具体的图表生成需求，测试结果，执行命令：
```bash
python -m app.tool.chart_visualization.test.chart_demo
```
结果应位于`worksapce\visualization`下，涉及到9种不同的图表结果

### 简单数据报表任务

给予简单原始数据可分析需求，需要对数据进行简单加工处理，执行命令：
```bash
python -m app.tool.chart_visualization.test.report_demo
```
结果同样位于`worksapce\visualization`下

# Examples

We put some examples in the `examples` directory. All the examples use the same prompt
as [Manus](https://manus.im/?utm_source=ai-bot.cn).

The Model we use is `claude3.5`.

## Japan Travel Plan
**Prompt**：
```
I need a 7-day Japan itinerary for April 15-23 from Seattle, with a $2500-5000 budget for my fiancée and me. We love historical sites, hidden gems, and Japanese culture (kendo, tea ceremonies, Zen meditation). We want to see Nara's deer and explore cities on foot. I plan to propose during this trip and need a special location recommendation. Please provide a detailed itinerary and a simple HTML travel handbook with maps, attraction descriptions, essential Japanese phrases, and travel tips we can reference throughout our journey.
```
