## 1. Executive Summary
AutoTool addresses the high cost and latency of LLM tool selection. By analyzing historical tool usage, it identifies "tool usage inertia"—predictable patterns in how tools are sequenced. It constructs a transition graph (nodes=tools, edges=probability) to predict the next tool, reducing the need for expensive LLM reasoning steps just to pick a tool. It achieves up to 30% cost reduction.

## 2. Key Concepts & Brainstorming
*   **Tool Usage Inertia:** Agents often follow standard patterns (e.g., `search` -> `read` -> `write` -> `test`).
*   **Transition Graph:** A probabilistic model of `Tool A` -> `Tool B`.
*   **Graph-Guided Execution:** Using the graph to pre-select or suggest the next tool, speeding up the loop.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current State in CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tool Prediction | None. LLM decides every step from scratch. | Inefficient. We re-ask "what next?" constantly. |
| Trajectory Mining | Logs exist in `codeswarm_events.jsonl` but aren't analyzed. | We have the data but don't use it to optimize future execution. |

## 4. Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Trajectory Analysis:** Create a script to parse `codeswarm_events.jsonl` and build a transition matrix of tool usage (e.g., how often does `edit_file` follow `read_file`?).
- [ ] **SurrealDB Storage:** Store these transitions in SurrealDB to keep a live "Tool Graph".
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering:** In the DevAgent's system prompt, include "Common Workflows" or "Suggested Next Steps" derived from this graph to guide the model (e.g., "After reading a file, you usually edit it. Consider using `edit_file`.").
