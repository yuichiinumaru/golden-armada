## 1. Executive Summary
Z-Merge introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous vehicle merging. It utilizes "Zone-Specific V2X Traffic Information" provided by Roadside Units (RSUs) to give agents a global view of the merging zone, allowing for safer and more efficient coordination than local-only strategies.

## 2. Key Concepts & Brainstorming
*   **Global Zone State:** Access to a centralized state provider (RSU) significantly improves local agent decision-making.
*   **V2X Coordination:** Agents communicating with infrastructure (and each other) to negotiate access (merging).

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current State in CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Conflict Awareness | Low. Agents might edit same files if parallelized. | No "Traffic Controller" to prevent edit collisions in real-time. |
| Zone-Specific Context | Agents get generic project context. | Agents don't get "Folder-Specific" or "Module-Specific" active context (who else is working here?). |

## 4. Implementation Plan

- [ ] **"RSU" for CodeSwarm:** Implement a `LockManager` or `TrafficController` in `AgentOS`. Before a DevAgent starts editing, it checks the "Zone" (directory/file) to see if others are active.
- [ ] **Context Injection:** When an agent enters a "Zone" (e.g., `codeswarm/core/`), inject summary of *other* active tasks in that zone into its prompt.
