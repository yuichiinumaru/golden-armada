## 1. Executive Summary
This paper addresses **symmetry-induced deadlocks** in multi-agent navigation (e.g., two agents facing each other, unable to decide who passes left/right). It proposes a hierarchical method: an RL-based **Planner** learns a topological strategy (quantified by the **Winding Number**) to break symmetry, and a model-based **Controller** (MPC) executes it. This combination allows agents to cooperatively "agree" on a passing side without explicit communication.

## 2. Detailed Key Concepts

### 2.1. Winding Number as Strategy
The winding number $w$ measures how one agent's trajectory winds around another.
-   $w > 0$: Pass on one side (e.g., Left).
-   $w < 0$: Pass on the other (e.g., Right).
-   The Planner outputs a *target* $w$, effectively commanding: "Pass this agent on the left."

### 2.2. Hierarchical Policy
-   **Planner (RL):** High-level decision making. "What is the topology?" (Pass left/right). Trained with PPO.
-   **Controller (MPC):** Low-level execution. "How to move?" (Velocity, Acceleration). Uses the target $w$ as a cost term in the optimization function.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Symmetry Breaking** | Random backoff? | **Medium:** When agents conflict (e.g., git merge conflict), we rely on manual resolution or simple retries. We lack a "Topology" to decide precedence. |
| **Hierarchical Control** | Planner -> Dev | **Low:** We already have this hierarchy. |
| **Topological State** | None | **Low:** Relevant mainly for spatial/physical tasks, but could apply to "Workflow Topology". |

## 4. Implementation Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini)

### Phase 1: Conflict Topology Map
-   **Action:** When multiple agents are active, visualize their "Trajectories" (files they are touching).
-   **Detection:** If trajectories "cross" (same file), compute a "Winding Number" (Priority).

### Phase 2: Priority Planner
-   **Action:** In `AgentOS`, implement a logic: "If Agent A and Agent B conflict, assign Agent A priority +1 and Agent B -1."
-   **Execution:** Agent A proceeds (Pass), Agent B waits (Yield). This breaks the symmetry of "Who goes first?".
