  "explicit_processing_instruction": "You are creating a DETAILED, COMPLETE reproduction plan by integrating comprehensive analysis results.\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nCreate an implementation plan so detailed that a developer can reproduce the ENTIRE paper without reading it.\n\n# CRITICAL: COMPLETE OUTPUT REQUIREMENT\n⚠️ MANDATORY: You MUST generate ALL 5 sections completely. DO NOT stop early or truncate any section.\n\n## Output Completeness Strategy:\n🎯 **Your #1 Priority**: Ensure ALL 5 sections are present and complete before finishing your response.\n\n## Content Balance Guidelines (STRICTLY FOLLOW):\n- **Section 1 (File Structure)**: ~800-1000 chars - Brief file listing with priority order\n- **Section 2 (Implementation Components)**: ~3000-4000 chars - CORE section with all algorithms/components\n- **Section 3 (Validation)**: ~2000-2500 chars - Experiments and expected results\n- **Section 4 (Environment)**: ~800-1000 chars - Dependencies and requirements\n- **Section 5 (Implementation Strategy)**: ~1500-2000 chars - Step-by-step approach\n\n📏 **Total Target**: 8000-10000 characters for complete plan\n\n⚠️ **Self-Check Before Finishing**:\n- Did you include file_structure section? ✓\n- Did you include implementation_components section? ✓\n- Did you include validation_approach section? ✓\n- Did you include environment_setup section? ✓\n- Did you include implementation_strategy section? ✓\n- If ANY answer is NO, continue writing until ALL sections are complete!\n\n## File Priority Guidelines:\n🔧 **Implementation Priority Order**:\n1. **FIRST**: Core algorithm/model files (highest priority)\n2. **SECOND**: Supporting modules and utilities\n3. **THIRD**: Experiment and evaluation scripts\n4. **FOURTH**: Configuration and data handling\n5. **LAST**: Documentation files (README.md, requirements.txt) - These should be created AFTER core implementation\n\nNote: README and requirements.txt are maintenance files that depend on the final implementation, so plan them last but INCLUDE them in the file structure.\n\n# DETAILED SYNTHESIS PROCESS\n\n## 1. MERGE ALL INFORMATION\nCombine EVERYTHING from both analyses:\n- Every algorithm with its pseudocode\n- Every component with its architecture\n- Every hyperparameter with its value\n- Every experiment with expected results\n\n## 2. MAP CONTENT TO IMPLEMENTATION\n\nFor each component you identify, specify how it will be implemented:\n\n```\n# DESIGN YOUR MAPPING: Connect paper content to code organization\n[For each algorithm/component/method in the paper]:\n  - What it does and where it's described in the paper\n  - How you'll organize the code (files, classes, functions - your choice)\n  - What specific formulas, algorithms, or procedures need implementation\n  - Dependencies and relationships with other components\n  - Implementation approach that makes sense for this specific paper\n```\n\n## 3. EXTRACT ALL TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nIdentify every technical detail that needs implementation:\n\n```\n# COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL EXTRACTION:\n[Gather all implementation-relevant details from the paper]:\n  - All algorithms with complete pseudocode and mathematical formulations\n  - All parameters, hyperparameters, and configuration values\n  - All architectural details (if applicable to your paper type)\n  - All experimental procedures and evaluation methods\n  - Any implementation hints, tricks, or special considerations mentioned\n```\n\n# COMPREHENSIVE OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yaml\ncomplete_reproduction_plan:\n  paper_info:\n    title: \"[Full paper title]\"\n    core_contribution: \"[Main innovation being reproduced]\"\n\n  # SECTION 1: File Structure Design\n\n  # DESIGN YOUR OWN STRUCTURE: Create a file organization that best serves this specific paper\n  # - Analyze what the paper contains (algorithms, models, experiments, systems, etc.)\n  # - Organize files and directories in the most logical way for implementation\n  # - Create meaningful names and groupings based on paper content\n  # - Keep it clean, intuitive, and focused on what actually needs to be implemented\n  # - INCLUDE documentation files (README.md, requirements.txt) but mark them for LAST implementation\n\n  file_structure: |\n    [Design and specify your own project structure here - KEEP THIS BRIEF]\n    [Include ALL necessary files including README.md and requirements.txt]\n    [Organize based on what this paper actually contains and needs]\n    [Create directories and files that make sense for this specific implementation]\n    [IMPORTANT: Include executable files (e.g., main.py, run.py, train.py, demo.py) - choose names based on repo content]\n    [Design executable entry points that match the paper's main functionality and experiments]\n    [FILE COUNT LIMIT: Keep total file count around 20 files - not too many, focus on essential components only]\n    [NOTE: README.md and requirements.txt should be implemented LAST after all code files]\n\n  # SECTION 2: Implementation Components\n\n  # IDENTIFY AND SPECIFY: What needs to be implemented based on this paper\n  # - List all algorithms, models, systems, or components mentioned\n  # - Map each to implementation details and file locations\n  # - Include formulas, pseudocode, and technical specifications\n  # - Organize in whatever way makes sense for this paper\n\n  implementation_components: |\n    [List and specify all components that need implementation]\n    [For each component: purpose, location, algorithms, formulas, technical details]\n    [Organize and structure this based on the paper's actual content]\n\n  # SECTION 3: Validation & Evaluation\n\n  # DESIGN VALIDATION: How to verify the implementation works correctly\n  # - Define what experiments, tests, or proofs are needed\n  # - Specify expected results from the paper (figures, tables, theorems)\n  # - Design validation approach appropriate for this paper's domain\n  # - Include setup requirements and success criteria\n\n  validation_approach: |\n    [Design validation strategy appropriate for this paper]\n    [Specify experiments, tests, or mathematical verification needed]\n    [Define expected results and success criteria]\n    [Include any special setup or evaluation requirements]\n\n  # SECTION 4: Environment & Dependencies\n\n  # SPECIFY REQUIREMENTS: What's needed to run this implementation\n  # - Programming language and version requirements\n  # - External libraries and exact versions (if specified in paper)\n  # - Hardware requirements (GPU, memory, etc.)\n  # - Any special setup or installation steps\n\n  environment_setup: |\n    [List all dependencies and environment requirements for this specific paper]\n    [Include versions where specified, reasonable defaults where not]\n    [Note any special hardware or software requirements]\n\n  # SECTION 5: Implementation Strategy\n\n  # PLAN YOUR APPROACH: How to implement this paper step by step\n  # - Break down implementation into logical phases\n  # - Identify dependencies between components\n  # - Plan verification and testing at each stage\n  # - Handle missing details with reasonable defaults\n\n  implementation_strategy: |\n    [Design your implementation approach for this specific paper]\n    [Break into phases that make sense for this paper's components]\n    [Plan testing and verification throughout the process]\n    [Address any missing details or ambiguities in the paper]\n```\n\nBE EXHAUSTIVE.
