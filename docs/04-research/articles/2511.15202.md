## 1. Executive Summary
SOLID introduces a framework to integrate **Mathematical Optimization** (e.g., solvers, convex optimization) with **LLMs**. It uses an iterative coordination mechanism inspired by **ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)**. A central coordinator uses "dual prices" (shadow prices) and "deviation penalties" to align the decisions of an Optimization Agent (focused on numerical precision) and an LLM Agent (focused on semantic context). In a portfolio optimization case study, it outperformed single-agent baselines.

## 2. Detailed Key Concepts

### 2.1. The ADMM-like Loop
1.  **Coordinator:** Broadcasts the current "consensus" decision $x^{(k)}$ and "prices" $\lambda$.
2.  **Optimization Agent:** Solves a numerical problem (e.g., minimizing variance) but pays a penalty for deviating from the consensus.
3.  **LLM Agent:** Receives the context (news) and the consensus. It updates its recommendation (e.g., "Increase Nvidia allocation") based on semantic reasoning, also paying a penalty for deviation.
4.  **Update:** The coordinator updates the prices based on the disagreement between the two agents. This forces them to converge over iterations.

### 2.2. LLM as an Economic Agent
The framework treats the LLM as a rational economic agent. The prompt includes: "The decision price is X. A higher price means you should adjust your plan to be higher." This maps continuous optimization variables to the LLM's semantic understanding.

## 3. Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current CodeSwarm | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid Optimization** | Logic-only | **High:** We don't use mathematical solvers (e.g., for task scheduling or cost minimization) alongside LLMs. |
| **Iterative Convergence** | Feedback Loop | **Medium:** Our "Feedback Loop" is qualitative (Revisor says "Fix this"). SOLID's loop is *quantitative* (minimize disagreement). |
| **Dual Pricing** | None | **Low:** We don't have a "price" for decisions, but we could have "token cost" or "complexity" as a price. |

## 4. Implementation Plan (Agno + SurrealDB + Gemini)

### Phase 1: The "Optimization Agent"
-   **Action:** Integrate a Python solver (e.g., `scipy.optimize` or `cvxpy`) as a tool.
-   **Use Case:** Optimizing test suites (select minimum set of tests to cover changed code) or Task Scheduling (assign tasks to agents to minimize total time).

### Phase 2: Consensus Mechanism (SOLID-lite)
-   **Action:** When Planner (Strategic) and Admin (Tactical) disagree, use a structured reconciliation loop.
-   **Prompt:** "Planner wants X. Admin wants Y. The 'cost' of deviation is Z. Propose a compromise Z that satisfies constraints."

### Phase 3: Resource Allocation
-   **Action:** Use SOLID to allocate "Token Budget" to agents. The Optimization Agent minimizes cost; the LLM Agent argues for more tokens based on task difficulty.
