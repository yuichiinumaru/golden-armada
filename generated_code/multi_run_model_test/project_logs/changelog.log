Round 1:
Dev Activities:
- DevAgentADK_1: Task for file /multi_test.py, Tool: write_file, Status: success, Result: File written successfully.
- DevAgentADK_2: Task for file /util.py, Tool: write_file, Status: success, Result: File written successfully.

Revisor Activities:
- RevisorAgentADK_1: Feedback status: success, Details: Code review complete. The `main_func()` is correctly defined in `multi_test.py` and it properly calls `print_message()` from `util.py` with the message 'Multi-test complete!'.
- RevisorAgentADK_2: Feedback status: success, Details: Code review complete. The `print_message(msg)` function is correctly defined in `util.py` and functions as a helper, as intended.

End of Round 1 Summary.
